## **Welcome to the world of Donkeys On Ketameme (DONK), a memecoin that symbolizes the unpredictable, whimsical, and sometimes nonsensical nature of the crypto world.**

### ֍ ***The Origin Story***

Once upon a time, in the rural outskirts of the cryptoverse, amongst the vast fields of mining farms, there lived a donkey named Dexter. Dexter wasn't just any ordinary donkey; he had a knack for stumbling into the most peculiar situations. One fateful day, while foraging for carrots, Dexter accidentally trotted into a mysterious cave filled with sparkly, swirling dust. Curious as ever, he sniffed around and took a big whiff. Instantly, Dexter's eyes transformed into bright colored swirls, and he found himself in a euphoric state of mind. The swirling dust was none other than a magical substance known as "Ketameme Sparkles," believed to unlock hidden, whimsical realms of the mind. As Dexter wandered back to his barn, he began spouting profound yet nonsensical wisdom to the other animals. All of a sudden, Dexter's mind became filled with knowledge about things he never even knew existed, 

### ֍ ***Features***

The coin's logo has taken on many different forms, but its foundation, remains resilient. In which ever variety you come across, the DONK token features Dexter in all his spaced-out glory. The difference in appearance and mood swings Dexter has experienced on his journey down the mysterious cave, satirically dubbed "K-HODL", are represented on each token design. A reminder to K-HODLers, to embrace the fun and unexpected turns in life, but also beware of the many dangers and scams that lurk around every corner in the cryptoverse.  So, don't be a FOMO. The first 1000 holders of the DONK token will be granted VIP access to the NFT series upon its release, and will receive a the rarest NFT of the DONK series, a digital representation of the DONK token created in our flagship digital underground studio, aptly named, the Keta Mines. At their core, each of these 1000 original NFTs carry the spirit of Dexter's emotional roller coaster, during his adventures in the K-HODL and his farm, Ketameme Green, along with his blend of curiosity, wit, whimsy, and a touch of chaos, with an occasional side of melancholy.

### ֍ ***Spaced-Out Farm Animals (SOFA) NFT Collection***

The DONK coin isn't just about the laughs and the lore. It has a unique purpose that ties into the growing world of NFTs. Dexter has also inspired the creation of The "Spaced-Out Farm Animals" (SOFA) collection. The generative NFT collection will feature a variety of spaced-out farm animals each on their own "magical formula" and each more spaced-out and whimsically illustrated than the last. Donkeys on Ketameme is the first series in the collection.

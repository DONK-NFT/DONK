        <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, in the rural outskirts of the Cryptoverse, amongst the vast fields of farms, there lived a donkey named Dexter. Dexter wasn't just any ordinary donkey; he had a knack for stumbling into the most peculiar situations. One fateful day, while foraging for carrots, Dexter accidentally trotted into a mysterious cave filled with sparkly, swirling dust. Curious as ever, he sniffed around and took a big whiff.</p>
        <p>Instantly, Dexter's eyes transformed into bright colored swirls, and he found himself in a euphoric state of mind. The swirling dust was none other than a magical substance known as "Ketamine Sparkles," believed to unlock hidden, whimsical realms of the mind. As Dexter wandered back to his barn, he began spouting profound yet nonsensical wisdom to the other animals.</p>
        <p>Word of Dexterâ€™s enlightened yet hilariously spaced-out state spread far and wide. "Donkeys On Ketamine" (DONK), is a memecoin that symbolizes the unpredictable, whimsical, and sometimes nonsensical nature of the crypto world.</p>

        <h2>The "Spaced-Out Farm Animals" (SOFA) NFT Collection</h2>
        <p>The DONK coin isn't just about the laughs and the lore; it has a unique purpose that ties into the growing world of NFTs. Dexter has also inspired the creation of The "Spaced-Out Farm Animals" (SOFA) collection.</p>
        <p>The generative NFT collection will feature a variety of spaced-out farm animals each on their own "magical formula" and each more spaced-out and whimsically illustrated than the last. Donkeys on Ketamine is the first series in the collection. These will be released within the coming months and more details will follow.</p>
        <p>Each donkey NFT will have distinct traits, from eyes to unique accessories, like cosmic carrots, psychedelic saddles, and magical manes. Some NFTs will be ultra-rare, depicting Dexter's legendary adventures in the Ketamine Sparkles cave.</p>
